Hello Karsten , Erik , Connor

I hope you guys like my Updated Version of My chat.

Whats new in this version:

1)Fixed code
	I fix some staff that you told me like  use const , referencing 
2)Fixed the color
	Now each Client has its own color
3)Cleaned Main.cpp
	I split everything in classes like Server Class and Client Class so the main is not
	cluttered any more
4)New Utils Class that i use for my staff instead of have this staff into main
	Also I Create a Log function to use for printing instead of std::cout

5)I Create my own String.Split function to split a long string with a delimiter

6)I Create some Server Commands
	For example you can change the color of the server or change the welcome message
	
If you want to change the server color just write
	-C[Space]  followed by the int of the color   (ex.   -C 1 ) is blue
Also you can change the Welcome message if you write
	-W[Space] followed by welcome message  (ex.  -W Welcome ) Set message to Welcome
You can see The list of currently connected clients by using the -U command

You can change the server name by using the -N[space] "Name"  Command

You can clear the console by use the -X Command

You can kick someone from the chat using the -K[space] "Socket"  Command

7)Fix: If The client close the console window Server can handle that and remove him from the list

8)Using socketSets.I found socketsets to work Better And faster

*All the above Commands work only for server
Please try all those commands and tell me what you think.
I believe you will love my chat and my work.
